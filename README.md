Hello and welcome to Expert Relay! 

This project proposes ExpertRelay, a business-events platform for seminars, expert talks, workshops, and industry panels.
It lets organisations and independent hosts create and promote events, audiences discover and book sessions, and industry 
professionals receive alerts when new events align with their interests or expertise.
Key design considerations for ExpertRealy include topic classification and interest matching, speaker accounts and credibility 
signals (via bios, affiliations, LinkedIn links, prior talks etc…), ticketing and capacity control for events, hybrid delivery 
such as in-person, live-streams, or recording access, and post-event follow-ups like slides, and transcripts.
